Social capital levels and its determinants have generally been studied either individually or at a regional or national level, leaving the local level with little empirical evidence. In this regard, this paper aims to provide an overview of both the determinants and levels of social capital, as well as the patterns of their geographical distribution at the municipality and county level in the Catalonia region. Specifically, three main hypotheses are considered in this study: 1. Local social capital in Catalonia has observable determinants. 2. The patterns described in similar empirical evidence for other territories regarding the determinants and distribution of local social capital are also present in the case of Catalonia. 3. Social capital is unequally distributed throughout the region. Approach The two main sources of conflict when studying social capital arise when dealing with its definition and its measurement, which has prevented the concept from gaining more importance. While some argue that it should not be called capital or that it is a community feature, the economic approach assumes that social capital is a feature of the individual. Regarding its measurement, survey data and proxies are the two main approaches followed in research. This paper follows the individual approach of economics, which allows for econometric modelling, using data on three indirect measures of social capital: average turnout in recent local, regional and Spanish general elections, associational density and average blood donations. Catalan municipalities over 5,000 inhabitants and 41 counties were included in the data set, except the five biggest cities, which experience too much variation in neighbourhood characteristics to be considered single entities and are therefore excluded from the analysis. Following the methodology of Becker (1965) and Rupasingha et al. (2006) regarding household allocation of time and social capital formation, the model assumes that the representative household of a municipality or county can invest in two items: composite consumption, which is a function of market goods and time devoted to their production, and social capital, a function of household social capital goods, the time allocated to their production, the household's own characteristics and the characteristics of other households. Investment in composite consumption implies the production of goods and activities, while social capital can produce observable social capital in the shape of associational density, election turnout or blood donations. The share of investment in each will depend on income restrictions, as well as on the amount of time available in each household and the prices of both market and social capital goods. This framework allows for performing ordinary least squares regressions, and the annual series of the data on blood donations allows for a panel data analysis of seven consecutive years. Further, adding independent and control variables to the model allows for the observation of social capital determinants. Specifically, data on the prevalence of immigrants, elderly people and highly educated citizens in the municipality and county were included in the study. The income, population size, population density, percentage of home ownership, altitude of the municipality and a measure of geographical mobility, which was calculated using the proportion of people moving in and out of the city and county every year, respectively, were also considered. The sources of data were the Statistical Institute of Catalonia, the Government of Catalonia, the Catalan Blood and Tissue Bank and the Spanish National Statistics Institute. Findings The results show a negative relationship between the percentage of owned homes and social capital in the municipalities, although the theory suggests that owning a home increases the roots of the household in the area and so does social capital. However, other evidence has also encountered this counterintuitive result. Similarly, geographical mobility negatively affects election turnout and blood donations, especially in municipalities, in line with the evidence and the theories linking residential stability with the creation of stronger social networks. The percentage of immigrants is associated with smaller political participation, which is coherent with their limitations in voting rights. Other variables do not show any clear effect on social capital outcomes, such as income, which is predicted to have a positive coefficient. Education has a limited and mostly positive effect, but it is far from the magnitude observed in the empirical evidence, which regards it as a key determinant of social capital. The proportion of elderly population seems to encourage the creation of associations and to discourage both blood donations, which in Catalonia are limited to people under 70, and turnout, which is counterintuitive since voting rates are traditionally high among older adults. The density of associations is clearly linked to higher turnout and blood donations. Altitude positively affects this density, so municipalities in mountainous areas tend to have more associations, while greater population density is related to less associational density and blood donations. In addition, an index to summarise the levels of social capital was created by performing a principal component analysis using the three social capital proxies. The highest levels were found to be located in inland municipalities under 30,000 inhabitants, with few exceptions. Eight of the nine municipalities with the lowest values belong to the Barcelona province, with five in its metropolitan area, validating the idea that commuter cities have low levels of social capital. Coastal cities are also affected by this phenomenon, perhaps due to the seasonal character of housing. Regarding the highest concentrations of social capital, they were mostly found in municipalities located in the provinces of Girona and Lleida, in eastern and western Catalonia, which are sparsely populated. The distribution of social capital in counties shows high levels in western counties and in the western part of the Girona province, while counties with access to the sea are generally poor in social capital. The main common characteristic of those areas is the predominance of sparsely populated towns with a few hundred inhabitants, since among the five counties with the highest values only the city of Ripoll contains more than 5,000 inhabitants and is therefore included in the study of the municipalities. Limitations The results of this study were subject to a number of limitations. The main issue has been the general lack of statistical data for municipalities under 5,000 inhabitants and the limited availability of statistics at the municipality and county level. This impedes the complete visualisation of the data, as well as the identification of causal impacts and the influence of age groups, family sizes, urban distributions, years of schooling and spending in health care and education on the outcomes. The suspected role that income inequality plays in social capital could not be checked due to the lack of recent data, while other data sources are only updated every decade. Further research could analyse the production process of local social capital in Catalonia, its relationship with the life cycle and the characteristics of areas with high levels of social capital that could be useful for policy purposes. The use of other measuring scales for big cities, such as neighbourhoods, would be highly valuable. The findings could gain precision when being able to use instrumental variables to find the causal impact, as well as when using the proportion of blood donations achieved in each campaign as a better measure of the intensity of blood donations. In addition, taking into account the role of geography and capital cities in each county would be highly relevant. Practical Conclusions and Original Value By studying three variables associated with social capital some of its main determinants have been identified in both municipalities and counties. Different outcomes in the county analysis were also observed in some cases. Some patterns go in line with the empirical evidence, so Catalonia is not an exception, but some differ, leaving room for future confirmation of those results. A social capital index is useful to compare both municipalities and counties, despite the fact that most municipalities are too small to be in the study, showing a pattern that seems to harm coastal areas and the Barcelona metropolitan area and to benefit counties with a high prevalence of sparsely populated small towns. This paper does not solve the issue of indirect measurement of social capital, nor the controversy surrounding the concept, but it might shed light on the local characteristics of social capital in Catalonia and its future research and policy implications. This contribution tries to explain those local differences with an unclear origin which promote social cohesion, with valuable insights for local public policy in terms of promoting and sustaining social capital. © 2020, CIRIEC.","Association density; Blood donations; Catalonia; Counties; Municipalities; Residential mobility; Social capital; Spain; Voter turnout",,"Coll, S.S.; Universitat Pompeu FabraSpain; email: sergisanchezcoll@alumni.upf.edu",,"CIRIEC",19896816,,,,"Spanish","CIRIEC Esp.

Despite the fact that Big Data has wide dissemination and acceptance in different scientific disciplines, its use in the field of Global Studies is still incipient. Taking this into account, this paper discusses the methodological challenges and presumable contributions that Big Data offers to Global Studies. Methodology: The starting point for this paper is the critical analysis of the conceptual bases of Big Data and its relationships with Global Studies. So, this paper proposes the possible applications of Big Data in the Global Studies contrasting some key concept. In this way, the conceptual elements that define Data Science are examined and compared with the paradigmatic conceptions of Global Studies. On these conceptual fundaments, the article discusses links, limits and, scopes of Big Data and how it can contribute to Global Studies. Conclusions: This paper concludes that technological tools based on Big Data can enrich our understanding of global phenomena only if we position ourselves in a critical attitude that recognizes that the choice of data and its analysis are decisions embedded in historical and social contexts. In this way, as with any other methodological approach, Big Data is only a partial way to obtain and analyze information. Originality: The originality of this paper is to shed critical light on the scope and limits of Big Data, beyond a positivist vision of scientific knowledge. In other words, this article recognizes the biases behind the supposed neutral explanations regarding the use of techniques based on Big Data. © 2020 Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia.

Educational hackathons are a new way to respond to some of the biggest challenges in education. This exploratory study seeks to define the key elements of these hackathons and to offer a theoretical and practical starting point for future publications and research. A literature review is carried out, with the information then contrasted with the experience as organizers of EDhack Raval, the first community-focussed educational hackathon in Catalonia. Observations, a questionnaire and interviews are used to add depth and objectivity to the wealth of data derived from field work. The results point to the valorization of the freedom of the creative process, the generation of community networks and social learning over the creation of solutions, findings that coincide with the latest research. Thus, the study concludes that educational agents would do well to appropriate, adapt and evaluate the assets of the hacker culture, making sure not to commit the error or organising hackathons that promote solutionism, elitism and competition. © 2020 Facultat de Psicologia, Ciencies de l'Educacio i de l'Esport Blanquerna.

In the dichotomy between describing the world using macrodata and prescribing preset behaviors after analyzing big data, algorithmic reason may give rise to closed communication systems that simplify and standardize our practices. In accordance with an essay and philosophical method that binds the form and substance of criticism together, the dimensions for a reflective theory of algorithms concern three fundamental facets: a) abstraction, mathematical encryption, and calculation; b) performative algorithm-induced passivity, and c) invisible, impersonal power. So, the major contribution of the article is the discussion of the constraints arising from algorithmic technologies. The emphasis on a critical theory of technology becomes all the more relevant as digital devices normalize as intermediaries in various fields of human activity. Therefore, it is about problematizing technology as the basis of everyday behaviors and decisions from a theoretical perspective.

The Internet has influenced communication and boosted new technologies, which have advanced dramatically in the first three decades of the twenty-first century. This has had an impact on the various economic activities, among which tourism is particularly salient. Consequently, consumers no longer have a receptive role. They have become decision makers with respect to the media material that they consume in addition to having the opportunity of being information providers. Mexico City (CDMX), as a tourism segment, is no exception. It depends on the communication of public and private actors, who, while having certain methodologies and tools to access their audiences, interact with an audience that decides on what it receives and gives its opinion on the web. Therefore, the objective of the research is to assess the associated concepts, pages and organizations related to tourism in CDMX on the website aimed at both a domestic and international audience, designed by the government and private sector together with the input of the audience as an information provider. Likewise, the study seeks to determine the countries with the greatest interest in Mexico City as a tourist destination, since this can be highly important for directing the marketing strategies. The methodology used to explore the phenomenon takes a documentary and quantitative form, since in a first stage it includes the documentary analysis and subsequently makes the mathematical exploration through the use of network analysis (ARS) to assess the role of Big data and Smart Data in the CDMX brand before the fragmentation of audiences. © 2020 Instituto Universitario de Investigaciones Turisticas.

There is a phenomenon of obfuscated widespread suggestion regarding the technological fascination prompted by intensive comercial publicity and propaganda. To try to understand the phenomenon we will study some of the most common kinds of algorithms, their rules and the concept of efficiency. Computing, Big Data and algorithms have multiple implications in everyday life that are showing their conditioning. On the other side, an alert should be generated that the “infallible” algorithms fail and their damages and consequences can become irreparable. In this situation, silenced criticism is beginning to proclaim that “The Internet Is Not the Answer”, which forms a “Creepy Line” of psychosocial behavioral experimentation, in a surveillance and control progression system, denouncing “the new cyber totalitarianism”, created based on a “Procrustean Bed”.

In this regard, it is necessary to analyze, discuss and reach a consensus on the basic technological training needed to perform quality journalism. Data journalism, appropriated by the Internet, is a specialization that requires knowledge of these tools and, consequently, ad-hoc training. But are communication faculties prepared to face these new training challenges and create new profiles in the era of big data? To answer this question, we present the preliminary results of research examining the study programs and course syllabi of undergraduate journalism and communication degrees at Spanish universities. The study confirms that there is no correlation between the demands of the professional journalism market and higher education training. This finding demonstrates how computer technology, as a knowledge base for data journalists, occupies a minimal place in the training of professionals, thus highlighting the urgent need to modify journalism curricula. © 2020 Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona and Universitat de Girona.","Communication; Curricular innovation; Data journalism; Professional skills; Training",,,,"Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona and Universitat de Girona",02112175,,,,"Spanish","Analisi",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087976305

On the one hand, it has become a preferred object of lawyers’ attention, who are concerned with establishing an adequate legal framework to face its risks. We are thus witnessing the emergence of an incipient “Artificial Intelligence Law”. On the other hand, the legal activity itself is beginning to be transformed as a consequence of the gradual introduction of “artificial intelligence in the Law”. The combination of big data, machine learning and natural language processing techniques is allowing the design of tools automating legal tasks that until now could only be performed by expert jurists. The development of this “legal artificial intelligence” presents certain difficulties, mainly due to the peculiarities of legal reasoning. In this paper, the author presents some of the main legal artificial intelligence systems, namely platforms for seeking legal answers, predictive codification tools and predictive analysis applications.

Using a quantitative methodology of descriptive-correlational character, five study constructs were analyzed in a sample of 126 teachers from both countries. The results show that despite the political, social and educational differences in each country, the perception of teachers is not so different.

Spanish Library and Information Science (LIS) journals have achieved a prominent presence in international databases. By studying the articles published in them, it is possible to determine the thematic evolution of research in LIS, a subject on which few studies are available. The current work presents a bibliometric and thematic analysis of Spanish journals included in the Information Science and Library Science category of the Web of Science between 2015 and 2019. On the one hand, the production of the journals is identified and analyzed individually and as a group, according to the data available in the WoS Core Collection, considering the productivity of authors, citations, organizations, countries, and core publications. On the other hand, the production of journals as a whole is analyzed using SciMAT, an open-source software tool developed to perform science mapping analysis in a longitudinal framework by identifying research themes that have been the object of research during the period of analysis as well as their composition, relationship, and evolution. The results highlight the specialization of Spanish LIS journals in a series of topics that can be grouped into five main areas, in order of impor-tance: social networks and digital media, bibliometrics and scholarly communication, open access, open data and big data, libraries, and information and knowledge management. Likewise, these journals have opened up their thematic focus to other disciplines, among which Communication stands out prominently, as reflected in the established thematic categories. This study establishes a reference framework for researchers in the Information Science and Library Science area, making it possible to understand new relationships and research opportunities both inside and outside the original knowledge area. © 2020, El Profesional de la Informacion.

For the analysis, a set of cause-effect indicators is applied following the framework of reference Drivers - Pressures-State- Impact and Response (DPSIR). One of the limitations detected is the difficulty in collecting data given the large number of continental water exploitation systems in the Demarcation. The socioeconomic results evaluated indicate the big bet for an economy of the service sector, which has meant a coastal population increase and the progressive abandonment of the agricultural sector. In all the islands, although at different percentage levels, there has been detected overexploitation, salinisation and contamination of some of their groundwater body masses.

For that reason, in this research, we expect to increase built up accuracy mapping for Bordj Bou Arreridj city in semi-arid regions (North-East Algeria) by focusing on the identification of appropriate combination of the remotely sensed spectral indices. The study applies the ‘k–means’ classifier. In this regard, four spectral indexes were selected, namely normalized difference tillage index (NDTI) for built-up, and both bare soil index (BSI) and dry bare-soil index (DBSI), which are related to bare soil, as well as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). All previous spectral indices mentioned were derived from Sentinel-2 data acquired during the dry season. Two combinations of them were generated using layer stack process, keeping both of NDTI and NDVI index constant in both combinations so that the multi-index NDTI/BSI/NDVI was the first single dataset combination, and the multi-index NDTI/DBSI/NDVI as the second component. The results show that BSI index works better with NDTI index compared to the use of DBSI index. Therefore, BSI index provides improvements: bare soil classes and built-up were better discriminated, where the overall accuracy increased by 5.67% and the kappa coefficient increased by 12.05%. The use of k-means as unsupervised classifier provides an automatic and a rapid urban area detection. Therefore, the multi-index dataset NDTI/ BSI / NDVI was suitable for mapping the cities in dry climate, and could provide a better urban management and future remote sensing applications in semi-arid areas particularly. © 2020, Universidad Politecnica de Valencia..

Research was conducted on the basis of quantitative data, cartographic material, census information and interviews with officials in government offices. With satellite images from Google Earth and through field-work, georeferenced thematic maps were elaborated using the free software of QGIS. The project began with a classification of the different types of popular urbanisations on the periphery of the city. The main form of housing in two thirds of the city as a whole, is that of various types of popular urbanisation: there are social housing developments built by private companies (fraccionamientos), neighbourhoods of self-built housing on formally subdivided land (colonias), originally informal settlements (asentamientos de origen irregular), and villages (poblados) or rural townships (localidades rurales). Although they are adjacent, they do not mix, which leads to a particular socio-spatial fragmentation of the periphery of the city. Real estate subdivisions are the type with the most barriers, placed by the developers as paet of their merchandising. Most urban studies have concentrated on the big metropolitan centres, and especially on the insular social housing estates (fraccionamientos) of the periphery. Few studies have taken up the subject of popular urbanisations and even less have analysed the fragmentation seen in intermediate cities. The study presented here has made the diversity of popular urbanisations more visible, with an emphasis on the importance of identifying the different types, studying their distribution, and explaining the important role their variety plays in the socio-spatial fragmentation of the city. © 2020, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

It is precisely in the EU where there is a special commitment to developing an ethics for a trustworthy AI in design and made in Europe, to position itself in front of United States and especially China, two countries that don’t pay much attention to the issue. Firstly, we describe the content of ethics of AI and its essential principles from the point of view of the dignity and rights; second, we describe the main five principles contained in the international declarations. Third, we include other basic principles which arise from the demands of empathy with humans. From a somewhat sceptical perspective, we argue the potential utilities of ethics of AI for the law: it is considered to be an especially preventive instrument and that an ethical governance of AI can be developed, following the examples of policies and frameworks on public ethics and institutional integrity. The phases to be followed are described in this regard. We explain in detail the opportunity and the basic content of codes of conduct and committees and other control systems.

The errors and massive discriminations and artificial stupidity are alerted. They are also followed the most important references in the literature about the dangers of these new technologies: the ""algocracy"", dictatorship or fundamentalism of the data, ""dataism"" or ""psychopolitics"" and the ""swarm"". Based on the above, regulatory approaches, models and principles are examined. The author affirms the need to take control and to regulate from the varied typology of risks. The time factor or the rhythm of the regulation is stressed. In this sense, it is valued the introduction of techniques of a liquid or biodegradable law, experimental in continuous beta, as well as the ""sandboxes"" techniques. Despite the criticisms about it, it is stated that we must move towards this innovation in the form of regulation. The necessary participation of the technology sector, computer specialists and specialists is also analyzed.

In a first approximation, we define retronymy as a relexicalization of an existing referent as a consequence of the appearance of a conceptual and formal neologism with which it maintains a semantic relation: i.e. the old guitar starts to be named acoustic guitar to contrast it with the more recent electric guitar. Retronymic creation, which we conceive as a complex net of semantic and formal relations and as a special case of lexical cycle, can be set within the general frame of lexical change in specialized contexts, and more precisely, in the so called induced neonimy. The analysis and the understanding of the linguistic principles that govern the retronyms’ formation constitutes, in our view, an interesting observatory on linguistic change and highlights the social and cultural implications of language and lexical evolution, which call for further dedicated investigations. Moreover, in our paper we present a first computational approach to the description of retronymy in Spanish, by diachronically exploring big data. This allow us to trace and visualize some characteristic retronymic profiles, thus permitting to test our theoretical proposals.

Scholars have underscored the effectiveness of Twitter in galvanising the opinion of broad sectors of the public and expressing the indignation of average citizens on issues of social concern (Bruns et al., 2015; Martínez, 2017). The rise of feminist social media activism has prompted a number of studies on the feminist movement’s use of hashtags to foster online conversations on specific issues (Jinsook, 2017; Turley & Fisher, 2018; etc.). This article examines the correlation between the degree of ideological commitment amongst social media users and the nature of their Twitter conversations on a given issue. The analysis focuses on Twitter conversations generated by feminists, influencers, journalists and politicians in reaction to the controversial sentencing of the Wolf Pack (La Manada) –a gang of men involved in a sexual assault perpetrated during the San Fermín festival in Pamplona. Big data techniques were used to explore the nature of messages containing four highly charged hashtags central to feminist discourse on this issue: #YoSiTeCreo (Yes, I believe you), #HermanaYoSíTeCreo (Yes, sister, I believe you), #Cuéntalo (Talk about it) and #NoEstásSola (You are not alone). Our findings indicate that the levels of ideological commitment of Twitter users participating in what was essentially a feminist conversation varied to an extent that impeded serious interaction amongst them, either online or offline. From the perspective of communication strategy, feminist hashtag activism would appear to be an intermediate step in a longer process of creating a higher consciousness regarding gender equality issues in Spain. © 2019 Communication & Society.","Big data; Digital conversation; Feminism; Hashtag activism; Politicisation; Twitter",,,,"Servicio de Publicaciones de la Universidad de Navarra",02140039,,,,"English; Spanish","Comun.

We will give reasons for its existence and its vitality in the educational system. This does not stop us from acknowledging the challenges it faces, especially in relation to the new technologies implied in its practice. We are at a crossroads in this service, since leaning towards one side or the other can make it disappear because it can be rendered unnecessary, or it can lead it to other functions different from the more traditional ones. Finally, we put forward three proposals, justifying them and suggesting solutions. Thus, we analyse the idea of changing the concept from teaching body to administrative body, seizing the opportunity that may arise in the new Education Law after an Education Pact is passed. As a consequence of the irruption of the new technologies, we propose a change in the Education Administration that will adapt the structures to the new times. Lastly, we advocate early training of inspectors similar to that offered to French ENA civil servants: one-year training after which they would join their positions with the qualifications adequate for a high Administrative body, which is what corresponds to the Education Inspection. © 2019, Ministry Education and Science.

There is not a unique methodological approach in the field of terminology, since what we call in this paper terminological scenarios can lead to different methodological pathways and stages –e.g. a compilation of neologisms found in newspapers, the compilation of a glossary for translation purposes, or a standardized glossary in a technical environment. The diversity of terminological scenarios also points to a variety of tools that are available for the terminologist: database management systems, text alignment tools, concordance programs, assisted and automatic translation tools, terminology detection systems, definition extraction systems, etc. A terminologist facing any given scenario must choose the appropriate set of tools. In this article, we pose a series of methodological questions about terminology work: although computing tools allow the researcher to deal with big data volumes, being more consistent, and allow him/her to validate hypothesis in a more objectively way, what other important things are left behind when is the tool, and not the researcher, who extracts evidences and presents results? We will answer to the following questions: in this process, are relevant data left behind? In which stages, specifically? Which type of data are lost and what impact do they have on the research goals? Besides data, which other aspects of the methodology can be affected? Since this research is done in a translation context, in the conclusions we will project the consequences of these reflections on the teaching-learning of terminology in translation programs. © 2019 Universidad de Antioquia.

The classic model of financial intermediation is threatened. This is both a consequence of the development and the application of new technologies that are transforming society and that are empowering individuals with new digital tools. Nowadays, banks are not only competing with each other. New actors have also emerged in the financial landscape, such as fintech (financial companies whose business model is technology-intensive) and techfin (technology companies offering financial services, especially large technology companies -or bigtech-). The extensive branch networks that are typical for traditional retail banking, such as in cooperative banks, are reducing their prominence in the face of the growing offer and digitized management of financial products and services. The credit cooperatives have traditionally been characterized by a special link with their base of members and customers based on physical proximity. This has allowed the acquisition of great knowledge of the economic activity within the territory where the cooperative banks are established. Digital transformation and non-face-to-face financial services can significantly affect this traditional relational model based on personal contact with the users. Consequently, faced with this paradigm shift and taking into account the particularities that define the cooperative banking model, there is an interest to analyse the perception of this sector on this important and accelerated technological change, both from the perspective of internal processes, as from the external perspective of its clients. At the same time, it is appropriate to inquire about whether this process is being perceived differently depending on the size of the cooperative bank, given the fact that the traditional model of cooperative banking has been based on a wide network of offices. This research would be, as far as it is known, the first to address such a task in the field of credit cooperatives, since the scarce studies found have a more general character about the banking sector as a whole. In order to comply with the proposed objectives, information has been obtained through a questionnaire, consisting of 20 questions of a quantitative and qualitative nature. The questionnaire has been answered by a large number of Spanish credit cooperatives (41 out of 62 existing cooperative banks). With the obtained answers, a statistical-descriptive analysis has been completed, through the application of common statistics, such as: arithmetic mean, standard deviation, percentiles, maximum and minimum. In turn, in line with the objectives set, statistics are presented including calculations for both, the sample set and for two sub-samples, in order to distinguish between entities of different dimensions. Once the analysis has been concluded, some remarkable results have been obtained. On the one hand, the cooperative banks that have been included in this study have indicated the necessity to improve their digital transformation. It can also be observed that the digital gap is perceived in relation to the rest of the banking sector. Managers are aware of the significant impact of the digital transformation of the economy and society. Technology-based tools, such as big data, may have the greatest impact on the commercial banking activity. Within the next five years an intense competition from technology- based companies is expected. Furthermore, the technological culture of members and customers is insufficient. On the other hand, it can also be observed that the dimension of the cooperative banks influences their perception of the digital transformation in the cooperative banking sector. In this sense, the cooperative banks that affirmed the existence of a wide margin of improvement in the operational scope have a smaller dimension and more seniority than the rest of the sample. Banks that have a higher number of total assets and a higher number of employees also perceive a greater margin of improvement when it comes to the internal management processes. Additionally, the results indicate that the perceptions of digital transformation are conditioned by the size of the entity. Larger entities perceive a lower degree of assimilation of the digital transformation by the organization's employees, giving it greater importance to the impact of different technologies. Large entities perceive less intensity of competition from foreign banks and value the degree of technological and financial culture of members and customers more. However, these results have limitations that have conditioned this research. These are basically founded on the fact that the analysis is based on the perceptions of the managers of the surveyed entities. This implies a degree of subjectivity conditioned by multiple non-controllable variables. With this general approach to different aspects related to digital transformation it has not been possible to contemplate other transcendental issues. The study culminates with a series of strategic suggestions that can be considered by the sector. Credit cooperatives, usually with a smaller comparative dimension with respect to the large commercial banks and based on federative models, cooperation or systems of cooperative concentration give special value to territorial self-identification and proximity to the members. Technology can be a factor of distancing that can lead to a loss of personal contact with members or clients. Therefore, the cooperative bank must design compatibility strategies between the philosophy of its specific business model and the assimilation of digital transformation. Precisely, its closeness to the client can be the way to acquire a prominent role in the financial-digital education process that society will demand over the next few years. Additionally, based on the results obtained, it can be said that, from a strategic approach, credit cooperatives must value or advance in various lines of digital transformation of their activity, both in their internal and organizational processes and in their relations with clients. In the latter case, the reduction of processing times for operations, the use of apps (mobile applications) and access systems that are increasingly simple, agile and attractive, can be essential. Special attention should be given to anything that implies a more satisfied customer experience and simplification of procedures, with a wider and more personalized portfolio of financial products and services. In this sense, the strategy should begin with evaluating the implementation of new technologies that already anticipate major changes.

The creation of an industrial fabric outside these centres depends on the individual initiative of local production companies, although it is difficult to maintain a continuous activity. The search for thematic differentiation leads to the production of proximity content, reducing management costs by taking advantage of the options provided by the Internet to distribute content. This work aims to analyse the way crowdfunding applied to financing audiovisual projects can help proximity content and, based on crowdsourcing, promote the development of audiovisual sector in areas far from important state production centres.The prosumer role assumed by users can encourage crowdfunding platforms to operate as a professional social network that facilitates the development of stable work teams, enabling the creation of the necessary audiovisual industrial fabric in territories with no tradition in the sector. Likewise, the purpose is to study the effectiveness of crowdfunding campaigns aimed at the audiovisual sector, analysing their features in relation to the professional sphere. In current audiovisual sector, divided into audiences and continuously evolving concerning business models, it is necessary to evaluate the suitability of any crowdfunding strategies standard for all kind of products. In the same way, making proximity audiovisual content for spectators, connected by geographic and thematic aspects, can find the appropriate way of financing and managing through crowdfunding and crowdsourcing platforms. Design/methodology/approach The object of the study was the audiovisual projects used by the Verkami and Lánzanos crowdfunding platforms to plan their financing campaigns. Both have big importance at state level as they cover needs of the sector. They excel in their length of service, volume and success rate and they include a specific section for audiovisual products, working according to the rewards model. A preliminary study of sectoral and geographical data was carried out, focusing on the territorial dispersion of audiovisual production and consumption, in order to tackle the issue of proximity content. Subsequently, the projects analysed for both platforms were divided into two large groups: documentaries on local subjects and feature-length fiction films developed by promoters not based in the two large state production centres. The study was carried out during the month of July 2016, on campaigns for which the deadline for receiving contributions had expired in that period. The analysis includes projects that were unsuccessful in reaching their funding target. Finally, conclusions have been drawn. Results/Research limitations/implications The campaigns analysed have a fundamental impact on emotions. Their description is based on highlighting the social and human interest of the main characters and the space portrayed audiovisually. The subject matter is the descriptive axis of the project, but, compared to the information that a professional production dossier would provide, essential aspects such as synopsis, locations, shooting plan and financing or budget of the project are avoided. In many cases it not mentioned whether it is a feature film or a short film, even though the way to face any project depends fundamentally on this question, defining, also in terms of budget, the real difficulty for a project and its feasibility. It is also important to know the stage the product is in when the campaign is called, this fact is usually provided, although not clearly enough. The estimated cost of the project and the percentage still to be covered are barely described. For this reason, the specific financing objective of each project does not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn on the real effectiveness of the campaigns in each proposal. The Official Budget tool would provide a suitable model for quantifying and identifying the items for which funding is requested, and also for managing a coherent crowdfunding schedule. The rewards offered are intended for patrons to feel important in the development of the product. The minimum and maximum contributions proposed follow the criterion of diversifying the options, generating multiple peaks in the final number of patrons, foreseeably local users as potential first spectators of the products. The feature films studied do not reach the usual minimum figures of the sector, and it can be inferred that this behaviour is closer to amateurism than to the professional world. The failure rate is relatively high in these campaigns, not assuming the economic expenditure involved in audiovisual production. The possibilities provided by the combination of a crowdfunding strategy with a crowdsourcing strategy, favouring the audiovisual professional activity of these areas, should be highlighted. The contributions of the patrons can be used for financing in exchange for rewards, but they could also cover the contribution with the professional experience from many users, who are capable of carrying out the specialised tasks required in teamwork such as audiovisual work. There is a niche of action crucial to facilitate the promotion of a more stable professional activity, which can generate an industrial fabric within the sector, non-existent in many geographical areas. Practical conclusions and original value The technological evolution of the audiovisual sector requires a constant reconversion of the business model, including the financing process. Thus, crowdfunding takes advantage of the collaborative practices enabled by the Internet, encouraging users to participate in projects and become an active part of the product. Platforms such as Verkami or Lánzanos turn patrons into motors for audiovisual projects that are akin to them in terms of subject matter or geography. This means that the idea of proximity is used as an instrument for selling the project, defining also the target audience of the campaigns, turning them into a possible system of communication between local producers and users. Similarly, as in the crowdsourcing philosophy, these can contribute with their capacities for a better development of the project, even in a continuous way, with the final goal of laying the foundations of an audiovisual industrial fabric in areas where it does not exist. The analysis of the campaigns on the Verkami and Lánzanos platforms allows us to conclude that the projects are maybe a bit unprofessional, which prevents us from taking full advantage of the possibilities offered by crowdfunding. Localised problems include the lack of information on the total budget, the destination of the funds or even the definition of the type of product (feature film or short film). There is also an excessive confidence in the predisposition of possible patrons, as well as a lack of delimitation of the same that would facilitate better structured campaigns. It is therefore inferred an overdimensioning of the real capacity of the promoter to undertake his product and an absence of realism on the economic needs of the same, achieving residual figures. The Official Budget should be used as a tool to plan financing through crowdfunding, segmenting the phases of preparation of the product and the campaigns located in them. © 2019 CIRIEC-España, Revista de Economía Pública, Social y Cooperativa.","Audiovisual; Crowdfunding; Crowdsourcing; Proximity",,"Nieto, B.C.; Facultad de Humanidades y Comunicación, Calle Parralillos s/n, Despacho 049, Spain; email: bcantalapiedra@ubu.es",,"CIRIEC",19896816,,,,"Spanish","CIRIEC Esp.

The main objective of the study is to analyze the existence of deontological guidelines on journalism and big data in Latin America, geographical area that has not been studied in that respect until now. To do so, content analysis was the methodology applied to a selection of 18 ethical codes adopted by associations of journalists in 18 countries to check if they comply with the principles established by authors such as Bradshaw, Ward, Singer, Dörr and Hollnbuchner, who adapt journalistic deontology to the specific context of big data. The results show the codes are poorly adapted to the ethical principles related to data verification. Instead, they are in line with what is considered to be a journalistic target (objectivity, honesty and public service) in the context of data journalism. It is also observed that, in general, the best adapted codes are those that have been approved or modified in recent years, such as the ones in Uruguay, Colombia and Chile, among others.

This phenomenon is not unique to the Mexican context, as it can be stated that most of the major cities in the world show increased rates of violence to a greater or lesser extent. With regard to the impacts of house theft, Mexico accounts for between 15 and 18 per cent of the total number of thefts reported between 2006 and 2016, and the national survey of victimization and perception on public security (ENVIPE) indicates that this crime has a 5,028 prevalence rate at the national level. In 2010, Ciudad Juarez reported 1,000 preliminary inquiries related to house theft; decreasing to 788 inquiries during 2013 and rising again to 908 in 2015. On average, 910 such cases were investigated 2010 to 2015. This is one of the offenses that has received little public attention, with an annual average of 910 inquiries during 2010-2015. House theft displays a heterogeneous geographical distribution in the city, showing a high concentration in the downtown area and in some suburbs such as: Primero de Mayo, Granjas Chapultepec, Revolución Mexicana, among others. In this context, the objective of this paper is to examine the geographical relationship between the location of the house theft and features of the socio-spatial environment in Ciudad Juárez. The working hypothesis is that house theft has can be explained largely on the geographical dimension of the environment of this phenomenon, with the criminal act concentrating on opportunities that are not random, either in time or in space. Therefore, the spatial behavior of the phenomenon should be identified considering the changes in the characteristics of the urban environment. The relationship between housing and crime has negative consequences when housing is cheap and located in less-favored areas that have been forgotten for decades. According to a literature survey, the factors that increase vulnerability include concentration of poorly-educated population, low levels of professional education, single-parent family, dependency on public assistance, poor housing, and lack of expectations and stimuli for people, but especially for the youth. The information used on house theft corresponds to the preliminary inquiries gathered from the Secretariat of Public Security in the Municipality of Juárez and variables from the 2010 Census on General Population and Housing. For the spatial analysis, the information obtained provides the address (nearest intersection), which was used for geocoding. The correspondence between offenses and the characteristics of the urban environment was explored using a geographically weighted regression estimated using the maximum likelihood technique. The geocoding of house theft reports yielded 2,484 events in the urban area. The distribution of this phenomenon is geographically governed by two factors: the international border and the Sierra de Juárez, which jointly determine a northwest-southeast direction. The neighborhood test evidences that significant clusters of house theft can be identified at the local level. We identified 38 high-incidence clusters of house theft and 25 high-value clusters named outliers. These results identified the variables uninhabited houses, population density, households headed by women, and concentration of young people as factors that influence house theft. The local model is adjusted to the conditions of housing development in Ciudad Juárez, characterized by large housing development units on the periphery, away from desirable conditions of accessibility to urban resources. On the other hand, there is the downtown area with high unemployment rates due to the deterioration of the area. Both cases are factors that are favorable for house theft. © 2018 Instituto de Geografia.

This interdiction produces a decrease of conceptions and a rebound after that period, which are difficult to detect because in populations that did not exercise effective control of the fecundity a peak of conceptions is observed during the spring. At present, this precept has disappeared as a result of a process of erosion that we do not know enough. With the anony-mized data of all the people surviving at the beginning of 2003 and born in Andalusia (n=8,397,206), this paper aims to determine the importance of this interdiction and its vanishing process throughout the twentieth century. This process takes part with the decrease of fertility and the erosion of seasonality of births. Finally, it is also analyzed to what extent this transition to modernity is the result of a process of diffusion that has gone from municipalities with a big population size to small municipalities.

In this sense, ethical banking limits the credit to non-socially responsible projects and it provides financing to vulnerable groups and investment with a positive environmental and social impact, at the same time that all its activities are transparent. The objective of this paper is to study the origin and features of the ethical banking, establishing the main differences with the traditional model, to analyse its implantation in Spain and to review the conditions and initiatives that Triodos Bank makes to position itself as the leader bank with ethical values. Methodology The implantation level and development of the ethical financial companies in Spain (Triodos Bank España, Fiare Banca ética, Coop 57, Oikocredit España, etc.) has been analysed through the data of its financial statements. However, in order to study the Triodos Bank's corporate strategy, an external and internal analyse has been made. In this sense, the PESTEL analysis, which studies the Political, Economic, Sociocultural, Technological, Ecological and Legal factors that set up the environment and how they can affect the activity, is used to identify the factors of the general environment that influences the financial company's strategical position. Regarding to the competitive environment, the Porter's ""Five Forces"" model has been analysed, its main competitors have been differentiated, as well as its main threats and opportunities. In order to do the internal analysis, four models have been used in the entrepreneurial scope: first, the weaknesses and strengths found in Triodos have been determined; second, the resources that contribute a competitive advantage according to the VRIO model, have been analysed; third, the ""Value chain"" described by Porter for the company, which describes the development of the activities performed by the bank to create value for the customer, is studied; and, finally, the Triodos Bank's organizational structure and the social and environmental data, are analysed. Results The ethical banking's customers belong to groups with a high social commitment, who need to know the destiny of their savings. In the same way that it has happened in traditional financial companies, since the beginning of the crisis in the ethical institutions (Triodos Bank España, Fiare Banca ética, Coop 57, Oikocredit España, etc.) the capital destined to the loan transactions was overcome by the bank customers' savings; the trend has been increasing and it is remarkable that in 2016 the savings almost doubled the capital given in loans. The increase experienced by the ethical banking is also reflected in the 48.26% increase in the number of customers and users from 2013 to 2016, and in its amount of capital, which was almost 171 million euros in 2016, and all of this with a low rate of defaulting. Regarding to Triodos, whose beginning in Spain is in 1998, even though it was in 2004 when it was converted into Triodos Bank España, the assets managed were 13,454 million euros in 2016, with a 9.40% annual increase. Regarding the sustainable sectors that are financed by Triodos, and knowing that the aim is to allocate to credit between 65% and 75% of own funds, it is remarkable environment (38%), social (24%), culture and leisure (14%), and loans given to people, city councils and sustainable residential mortgages (24%). The Triodos Bank's strategic analysis shows that the distrust created by the non-ethical political practices has led to rules that search for the transparency of the financial system; moreover, the traditional banking's abusive practices have originated the demand of ethical products and companies by society. Likewise, the banking's development through the Internet and the mobile apps have implied the disappearance of regular offices. However, the threat of new financial companies in the sector of ethical finance is a reality, since the absence of a strict regulation for the ethical banking provokes that several traditional companies offer their saving and credit products under the name of sustainable, and this confuses customers. Nevertheless, Triodos is a European consolidated bank, it has a bigger infrastructure that its ethical competitors, it is a financially healthy company, with trained personal and it provides all kinds of financial products and services, what allows it to be competitive to face traditional banking. The model VRIO notes that a resource provides a competitive advantage if it has the attributes: valuable (V), rare or scarce (R), inimitable (I) and related to the organisation of the enterprise (O). If it is applied to Triodos Bank, we can be sure that human resources (staff who is trained and with experience in the banking sector) and the intangible resources (solid image of a financial group with a successful trajectory) are a sustainable competitive advantage, while the tangible resources (branch network) and the client portfolio which share the company values, suppose a competitive parity with the rest of banking companies. The Triodos' organizational structure, which is different from other financial companies and it is based in the Triodos' Foundation for the Administration of the Shares, allows it to have control of the decision making and not to be subjected to the shareholder's power, assuring the fulfilment of the ethi- cal values. On the other hand, the success of the implantation of Triodos depends to a great extent on the workers in the company, who have to be qualified and motivated with the mission and have to be able to put it in practice daily in the development of their work. The company has the commitment to invest an important amount of resources in training programs and professional development, with the purpose of training its workers. In this sense, the average expense in training by worker in 2016 was 1,731 euros. Practical conclusions and original value The inclusion of the ethical banking model in Spain is relatively recent; in fact, no companies like this have been created in the Spanish financial system as of yet. Up to now, the rule has been to stablish branch offices, following the model applied in other countries by consolidated companies, like Triodos Bank and Fiare Banca ética, and to act according to the lines of financing that lead to the development of sustainable projects, sharing actively this banking business segment with financial companies which are called traditional banking, like BBVA, CaixaBank and Banco Santander. This sector may become saturated and, somehow, dilute efforts to ensure that the perception of society is based on a business model that includes social, environmental, cultural and economic results. The cooperatives that trade ethical saving and financing products, like Oikocredit and Coop57, also have an important role to establish and consolidate an ethical finance model, though more residual. Ethical banking in order not to be a mere illusion associated with financial crisis periods and to become definitely in a consistent alternative, it should offer services and products similarly to the conventional banking and an economic and social profitability to contribute to their credibility and a clear differentiation in equality of conditions with the traditional banking. This paper provides a strategic analysis without precedents about ethical banking in Spain, focused on Triodos, which is the leader ethical banking company. Traditional methodologies of external and internal analysis have been applied to this newly created sector providing useful information to its future implantation, as the strengths and weaknesses of this sector have been shown. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.","Ethical Finance; Social Bank; Socially Responsible Investment; Strategic Plan; Triodos Bank",,"Segura, E.A.; Departamento de Economía y Empresa, Spain; email: eas297@ual.es",,"CIRIEC",19896816,,,,"Spanish","CIRIEC Esp.

Based on documentary and archaeologic data, an analysis of the town's defensive system is suggested, from the preliminary constructions in 1476 to the first steps towards the introduction of the first bastion system of fortifications, including its main points of interest and connecting them with some presently preserved remainders. The introduction of a defensive system adapted to the piroballistic artillery was not almost immediate but the result of a protracted process in which the continuous conflicts among the main European powers in the end of the XVth and the beginning of the XVIth centuries were an excellent testing ground. Given its position near the border with France, the biggest enemy of the Hispanic Monarchy, who would become the main power in Europe in the XVIth century, the fortification of the town of San Sebastian with the most modern defensive systems was a priority. Through the conducted research, it has been determined the age of the first rampart adapted to the piroballistic artillery, identifying the existing remainders and suggesting its author. This new rampart, a barrier, was begun in 1476 and was located in an advanced position in relation to the town's medieval defensive system, which consisted of a surrounding wall with towers and gates. The barrier allowed for the adaptation of the existing medieval defensive system in order to deal with the use of artillery. New military confrontations will lead to the reinforcement of the barrier by means of the construction of a series of artillery towers since 1512. This paper allows for the progress in the understanding of a so far little known construction, identifying the names, location and characteristics of the towers and gates of its wall, which has been possible to rebuild in detail. It is also described in detail the 1528 project for the general refurbishment of the wall, finally cancelled after the construction since 1529 of the famous south front defensive system designed by Gabriele Tadino di Martinengo. Furthermore, this research also includes the so called La Mota Castle, who dominates the city from the top of Urgull mountain, and whose medieval characteristics we have reconstructed, identifying the first constructions of the current castle in 1528. © 2018 Sociedad de Ciencias Aranzadi.

Los emprendedores que participan en una Aceleradora viven una experiencia que es crucial para la supervivencia, desarrollo y expansión de su start-up. Las Aceleradoras están generando una enorme expectación en España con Valencia a la cabeza, pero son un fenómeno muy reciente por lo que las evidencias empíricas existentes a día de hoy son poco concluyentes o inexistentes. De ahí el carácter pionero de nuestro estudio, el cual ofrece a partir de una muestra de 116 aceleradoras una aproximación al alcance del empleo generado por las start-ups ubicadas en ellas. Las evidencias empíricas encontradas aportan valiosas implicaciones prácticas a tener en cuenta a la hora de generar expectativas realistas acerca de estos instrumentos. Los resultados, de carácter exploratorio, demuestran que las Aceleradoras localizadas en EEUU estimulan la creación de un mayor número de start-ups que en otros países, así como de puestos de trabajo. El estudio identifica las variables que más intensamente inciden en la creación de nuevas empresas y sus niveles de empleo. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.Accelerators are still an emerging tool pointed to speed up the birth and growth of innovative start-ups. The Seed Accelerator programs (SAPs) usually provide entrepreneurs with accommodation, mentoring and training during a short period of three to six months, and are believed to be useful for a more effective launch of start-ups. Due to their emergent nature, the impact and expectations of Seed Accelerators remains largely unknown. Most of them were established after 2010 and their track record is still insufficient to define trajectories and draw definitive conclusions. Notwithstanding, finding evidence on the accelerators impact and benefits at the economic, social and territorial levels, is a topic of undisputed attention. The few studies conducted on the subject so far, suggest a straightforward and positive impact over the hosted firms but only in the elite accelerators. The Seed Accelerator (SA) phenomenon is awaking interest amongst a broader number of social entrepreneurs and innovative start-ups developing projects with social impact, which can be hosted in social-driven accelerators, a format rapidly growing in Spain since the emergence in 2011 of SocialNest. The mounting range of innovations with social content is opening up new business opportunities for social technological start-ups, defined as new ventures that develop and deploy technology-driven solutions to address social needs in a financially sustainable manner. The main purpose of this study is to approximately assess, for the first time, the Seed Accelerators capacity to make a social contribution in terms of employment generated by the new ventures participating in the acceleration programs. The originality lies in being pioneer in identifying the factors underlying a higher impact of these initiatives in terms of employment and other key performance indicators. This objective will be empirically fulfilled through a sample of Seed Accelerators, assembled from an online Global Seed Accelerator survey with data on SAs and the accelerated companies that have participated in Accelerator Programs. Three samples are finally built: the global sample with 116 SAs, a second sample including only the 63 SAs with at least one round of investment over 1milion $, and a third sample comprising only the 33 SAs having managed to ""exit"" one company for at least 1milion $. The model of analysis is based on the Business Incubators literature due to the newness of the SAPs with practically no previous studies having assessed these initiatives yet. The dependent variable is the Average number of employees per company. The model contains 12 independent variables, most of them indicators of performance of the Seed Accelerator programs, leading to four hypotheses to be tested. - Hypothesis 1 expects the SAs located in the USA to excel in the main performance indicators. - Hypothesis 2 expects better prospects on the SAs hosting start-ups in a more advanced development stage and accounting for a larger number of employees per company. - Hypothesis 3 expects the SAs with at least one company receiving investment above 1milion $ to be able to create more employment and reach better performance indicators. - The bivariate statistical analysis is the method selected to test these three hypotheses. - Hypothesis 4 will unveil the variables more significant for the creation of employment in the start-ups participating in SAs programs. A GLM Gamma model has been built in order to test this last hypothesis, giving rise to two significant variables: the rounds of investment and the amount of investment per company. Consequently, and in accordance to our results, the SAs better positioned in these two investmentled variables, are the ones displaying a larger capacity to generate employment and attaining a broader social impact. The study uncovers the key factors underlying the generation of employment by the start-ups hosted in SA programs, hence becoming helpful to those institutions and agents, public and private, promoting supportive programs to the emergence of innovative new ventures. As anticipated by Hypothesis 1, the SAs located in the USA effectively outperform the others in most indicators and their participated start-ups tend to create more employment. Moving to Hypothesis 2, the leading SAs in terms of employment per company are the ones hosting a larger number of companies and enjoying better performance ratios. However, the generation of employment in the SAs with at least one company receiving investment above 1milion $ is not bigger than in the rest, a finding leading to reject Hypothesis 3. These findings raise several conclusions and implications for management. First, investors effectively play an outstanding role in the success of both the SAs programs and the accelerated start-ups. Therefore, in order to increase the impact of SAs in terms of generation of employment, the SAs promoters should be especially proactive in the attraction of investors, mainly Venture capitalists and invite them to close investment rounds in the hosted start-ups. Our study reveals the SAs with the highest social impact, measured in terms of new employment, are those having succeeded in closing rounds of investment and consequently, reaching a higher amount of investment per company. As expected, the SAs located in the USA and those hosting a larger number of start-ups, also outperform the others in terms of employment. This advantageous position exhibited by the USA Accelerators most likely obeys to their longer experience and the broader support received from investors. In order to become attractive to entrepreneurs and increase their social impact, the promoters of Seed Accelerators in Spain should weave stronger ties with agents endowed with investment capacity, including family offices, ventures capitalists, large corporations or successful entrepreneurs. Otherwise, the advantages a SA can offer to the tenant firms and their potential impact over the territory get diluted. The findings also open the door to new proposals for the policy makers. - First, an effective selection system of projects and entrepreneurs is a first condition worth bearing in mind, not always met by the existing SAs in Spain. - Second, it seems beneficial at the social level to promote SAs specialized in specific sectors and industries, sponsored and supported by large corporations from the region. This would result in new start-ups created more attached to the territory and ready to attain higher levels of employment generation and social impact. - Third, in order to attract more start-ups and upgrade their chances to survive and grow, the high education offer should be flexible and rapidly adapt to the changing needs in skills and abilities by the top technological sectors. - Finally, the ability to attract and retain in the territory a sufficient number of investors, mainly Business Angels and Venture capitalists, is essential to the emergence of new SAs and to maintain the existing ones. Insofar limitations of the study, the relatively small size of the sample has prevented the application of more advanced statistical techniques. Finally, a methodological limitation, difficult to overcome, lies in how to gauge the actual role played by the Accelerators in the success of participating firms. This role at the early stages is clearly crucial but the question of whether these start-ups would have been equally successful without SA intervention remains unresolved. Undoubtedly, further research is needed to address the following question: What proportion of start-ups might not have prospered without the aid of an accelerator? For future research, we plan to build a broad sample of start-ups in Spain, making the distinction between those participating in SAs programs and the rest. The purpose would lie in finding out the specific advantages of SAs and their effectiveness in generating start-ups able to create new and highly qualified employment. © 2018 CIRIEC-España.","Aceleradora de empresas; Business-incubator; Incubadora de empresas; Medidas de desempeño; Performance measures; Profitability; Rentabilidad; Seed-accelerator; Start-ups; Start-ups",,"Saiz, L.C.; Universitat de ValènciaSpain; email: isidre.march@uv.es",,"CIRIEC",19896816,,,,"Spanish","CIRIEC Esp.

I also analyze the alternative model proposed by Solove (2013), to explain why it is not essentially different from notice and choice model.

The article provides evidences of the uneven development of the mortgage crisis in the Spanish cities. The study is based on data exploitation of housing stock in the hands of the SAREB acquired through foreclosures. The spatial analysis of the distribution of housing units owned by SAREB in three cities (Alicante, Murcia and Zaragoza) has allowed identifying neighbourhoods with a special concentration of housing dispossession processes. The results show how foreclosures are tending to focus on the most vulnerable neighbourhoods, which translates to a deepening of their precarious situation.

To give an answer the objective proposed, we assume a descriptive research design, where the collection approach and analysis of data have been defined as mixed, which include qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (questionnaire) techniques. For questionnaire validation the expert judgment technique was used, as they were selected by the «expert competence coefficient» or «K coefficient» procedure. The reliability analysis of the questionnaire through the Cronbach test was 0.957. The questionnaire was answered by 549 teachers from Continuing Education Centres in Andalusia and there were 23 in-depth interviews with key informants (centre directors and section coordinators). The results clearly show the perception, both of teachers and of those who exercise leadership, that the students of these schools are not sufficiently prepared to start their own business project, in spite of studying subjects of an enterprising culture. They consider that have not yet acquired the entrepreneurial skills necessary to create and manage an efficient business project, with lack of creativity constituting one of the biggest obstacles to that end.

Del Valle, Cd. de México, CP 03100, Mexico, Posdoctorante de la Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, Ciudad de México, Mexico, Universidad de Baja California, Mexico","In 2015, after decades of international agreements, the United Nations adopted the ""Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development"", the action plan for the next 15 years to try to solve the current human development problems. This strategy includes 17 goals (no poverty; zero hunger; good health and well being; quality education; gender equality; clean water and sanitation; affordable and clean energy; decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; reduced inequalities; sustainable cities and communities; responsible consumption and production; climate action; life below water; life on land; peace, justice and strong institutions; and partnerships for the goals), and 169 targets that are integrated together and are non divisible, and which cover environmental, social and economic aspects. To achieve these goals and targets it is necessary that governments and civil society participate together. México is one of the countries that signed the Agenda 2030. It is characterized by its big extension (1'973,000 km2) and population (123.5 millions), low economic growth of 2.3% in 2016 (El Economista, 2017), a high poverty level of 43.6% (Coneval, 2016), and a huge biodiversity (fifth place worldwide according to Llorente-Bousquets y Ocegueda, 2008). Because of this complex situation, it is particularly important to assess the contribution of Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to Mexican sustainability. Thus, the objective of the this paper is to propose a general overview of the development of the Mexican NGOs, and to analyse the degree of coincidence of their activities with the UN Agenda 2030's framework for sustainable development. We use a framework close to constructivism and principally qualitative methods, including analysing and researching documentary information and statistic data, while maintaining an interdisciplinary perspective to study the three fundamental sustainability aspects (environmental, social and economic). The information sources included mainly NGOs web pages, the Ministry of Government (Segob), the Social Development Institute (Indesol), complemented with direct information provided by different stakeholders from the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat) and NGOs', which provide different perspectives. We began by identifying the NGOs and their regional localization. Mexican national records have more than 30,000 NGOs (according to Indesol). The NGOs activity in México is regulated by the law called Ley Federal de Fomento a las Actividades Realizadas por Organizaciones de la Sociedad Civil (LFFAROSC), approved in 2004. This law establishes 19 NGOs activities, and activity number 12 relates to sustainable development (SD) and includes: advice for the use of natural resources; environmental, flora and fauna protection; preservation and restoration of the ecological balance; as well as, sustainable development promotion at regional and community levels in urban and rural areas. We work with a subgroup of 5,636 NGOs related to SD, based on activity 12 of LFFAROSC. Later, we reduce the group to 21 NGOs recognized for their contribution at national level and which have accessible information. These 21 cases where selected by the characterization of a set of variables including their activities, their age and experience, their relationship with the government and the civil society, as well as, the origin of their resources. Then, the contribution from their activities to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals included in the Agenda 2030 is analysed. It was found that the Mexican NGOs had fast growth and that they have been focused on activity 12 of the LFFAROSC. Also the goals proposed in the Agenda 2030 related to the sustainable cities and communities, life on land, responsible consumption and production, quality education, and affordable and clean energy are covered by the NGOs. In contrast, some of the goals are not the main focus of the analysed NGOs, such as: no poverty, zero hunger, reduced inequalities and quality education (in addition to environmental awareness), among others. Nevertheless, these goals may be covered by NGOs that work in other LFFAROSC activities. Other goals that are not contemplated by the law, particularly those related to economic and political topics (decent work and economic growth; industry, innovation and infrastructure; and peace, justice and strong institutions), where NGOs have less possibility to act. Hence, these responsibilities depended mostly on the government. In summary, the NGOs contribution to achieve the goals of the Agenda 2030 is relevant in the national context and fundamental in some country regions with less support for governmental programs. There are some limitations to this study: 1) the 21 NGOs selected for the analysis are not representative of the complete NGOs universe related to SD; 2) the variables used for the analysis where helpful according to the objective of this paper, specialty the description of the NGOs activities, the experience, their relationship with government and civil society, as well as the origin of the resources. Nevertheless, it will be helpful to have data about financial and human resources availability (volunteers and remunerated); and 3) with regards to the production of knowledge of the NGOs, we only did a general description of the variety of documents that they use for the diffusion of knowledge, but a deeper content analysis is necessary to think about quality and utility. The work presented constitutes a first approach to the contribution of the main NGOs activities to SD in México. Further research could look at an impact evaluation that identify, quantify, explain and assess the influence to the country in the light of the goals of the UN Agenda 2030.","Assessment; México; Non-Governmental Organizations; Sustainable Development Goals",,"Cardozo, L.R.Rodríguez Saro 424, B 402, Col.

The objective is to warn about weak points of the Spanish model of work-life balance and co-responsibility and outline certain proposals so that, in some way, contribute to overcoming the existing inequalities between women and men, and their consequences. Due to the fact that each EU member state is responsible for family policies in an exclu sive way, it is not surprising that the debate on the need to implement a new strategy of co-responsibility strategy has usually been limited to the social and political tradition of each country, with clear differences between the rights of the different States of the Union. It must be borne in mind, then, that gender equity and social equity are two ele ments intrinsically linked to each other and that, consequently, one cannot exist without the other; only full effectiveness of both will ensure social and economic sustainability From a mere legal point of view, the Spanish work-life balance model is the result of a long journey. The path that has been followed in our country, with significant improve ments on regulations, began its journey at the end of last century, with the approval of important laws at that time that wanted to respond and approve certain action plans of sectorial nature on that matter. With the approval of Law 39/1999, the first Spanish spe cific legislation to promote work-life balance, Spain acquired a new commitment aimed at promoting the participation of women in the labour market. Nevertheless, the sexual division of labour, based on a structure that values paid work and does not take into ac count domestic and care work, undoubtedly hampers the real progress towards equality between women and men and towards an efficient and sustainable economy. The 2004 Organic Law on Comprehensive Protection for Victims of Gender-Based Vio lence and the Organic Law on Effective Equality between Women and Men, which has been in force since 2007, will shape a legislative block that aims to be decisive in the empowerment of women and in the fight against gender-based violence, with a cross-cut ting approach that will, from a «formal» perspective, mean a significant achievement in gender equality. Official data show that women are the ones who continue to take on the majority of care work and domestic work; therefore, effective policies are needed to make men aware of genuine co-responsibility that goes beyond their involvement in shar ing family and domestic responsibilities. It should not be forgotten that co-responsibility must have a global dimension and must be spread throughout the whole society. Accurately defining and drawing up mechanisms in this direction is not easy; However, an advanced society needs to take certain measures with sufficient resources to promote the balanced acceptance of domestic responsibilities. These policies must, in any case, favour co-responsibility in the above-mentioned terms in order to strictly protect female victims of gender-based violence in their various aspects - economic violence, sexist vio lence, sexual violence, symbolic violence, etc.; we have to bear in mind that we are facing a group phenomenon - one suffers for being part of a group - in which the social position of all women, who belong to that group, is also affected. It is also urgent to promote the implementation of a global educational and training project that starts in schools for girls and boys from an early age, and that staff specialized and trained teachers in equality and anti-discrimination law. This is a «big» reform, of global dimension, that responds to a polyhedral problem that represents harm and social damage. It should be emphasized that gender violence is a multi-faceted blot, comprising sexual and gender-based violence, but also economic vio lence, based largely on some lacks in a system that perpetuates sexist stereotypes and shows evidence of the asymmetry of power between men and women. A model of wrong co-responsibility ends up causing more problems than solutions, and can lead to violence in its different expressions and forms. A system of work-life balance designed exclusively for women also stresses the gender pay gap between women and men, perpetuates the so-called «female glass roof», and meets weak mechanisms of social protection. Law must be a tool, but not the only one, and not an obstacle to this necessary social change, and must reconsider the importance of the «globalisation» of work-life balance measures. Spain has to shift its gaze to the most advanced European countries in this field; it must redesign its work-life balance model to direct it towards effective co-respon sibility, committing workers of both sexes, not just women. Spain needs to implement an authentic system of work-life balance that is solid, univocal and egalitarian, as our neighbours in the North have already done. We have to adapt the work-life balance meas ures to new times and overcome the obstacles that prevent, or at least make it difficult, gender equality from being a real and effective right. It is high time society, as a whole, gave shape to a citizenship committed to being an «equal working-caretaking» society.","Co-re sponsible economic policy; Co-responsible work-life bal ance; Female vital cost; Globalisation of work-life balance measures; Parental and maternity leave; Work/Leisure/family conflict",,"Megías, P.E.; Universidad de Castilla-La ManchaSpain",,"Ministerio de Empleo y Seguridad Social",22543295,,,,"Spanish","Rev.

A lot of cases of the wrong use of data, images, passwords, couple’s privacy or the social victimism because of the spite are set out according to a questionnaire. It has been composed by 10 items and arguing groups, 511 teenagers as participants from 16 to 19 years old from Huelva and Granada (Spain). This way is changed into a measure of control and violence in the couples. Firstly, the questionnaire was distributed and three arguing groups were elaborated among the participants. Information has been analyzed in a quantitative and qualitative way. Most of people state that they don’t develop and get these types of behaviours as measure of pressure. However, social networks have been found to be used to intimidate, control the couple, usurp the character and even the violation of privacy after the couples’ break ups. Besides, most of the survey respondents appreciate the boys’ behaviours towards their couples as «usual» and «expected» because of the confidence and the claimed love. These are called domestic violence. It’s necessary a bigger training in the use of social networks and to promote different measures of couple’s violence through these systems. © 2016, Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia.

Even lower is our information on decisions and conditions that led these groups to settle and/or move along the geography. Fortunately, the recent increment of the interest in paleogeographic analysis, the development of new theoretical models, the dissemination of technical procedures and the progressive incorporation of new computational tools, have made possible the emergence of new approaches to the phenomenon of paleolithic territoriality. In the geographical context of this study, on the southern slope of the Western Pyrenees, the work done by A. Tarriño, have made an essential contribution to this subject. While studies of researchers such as Ch. Normand and F. Bon, among others, have done the same on the northern slope. The use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to study the mobility of human groups, has a long history in the peninsular archaeological research, especially in stages of Recent Prehistory. Nevertheless, in the Paleolithic, this tool has not had a similar development. However, on the Cantabrian coast there are new works that use this tool (using optimal routes) and concepts such as accessibility or cost (among others) in the study of settlement patterns or territorial management of faunistic resources. In the present study we intend, from the concept ""cost"", to present an approach to flint collection strategies by Upper Paleolithic groups of the western Pyrenees, with the help of tools such as GIS. The application of converse tool has been carried out to establish a standardize geographical framework on both sides of the Pyrenees. Using the LCP methodology, we have reflected on a map the directionality and the most favorable to human movement from each archaeological sites, and we have obtained quantitative data (CU) which relate orography and distance. The characterization of this data through the fuzzy logic allow as establishing a criterion to define the autochthonous and allochthonous degree of each variety of flint. Finally, through descriptive statistical approach, we have related this dataset with the percentage of flint from each archaeological layer. This methodology allows as to approach to the complex mechanisms of recruitment of raw materials. This is based on two overlapping models: one based on the recurring collection and short-range mobility (for obtaining autochthonous flint); and another based on occasional recruitment inserted into a bigger circuit of mobility (reflected by the existence of allochthonous flint). The location of each site marks clear differences between the chosen flint and, in turn, three zones of influence. A western area, with a preponderance of peninsular types; a central area, with a high mobility and flint from both sides of the Pyrenees; and eastern area, with majority presence of northern Pyrenean flint. The factors that create these zones are related to the restrictions set by the terrain. These determine the areas of influence of autochthonous flint: Flysch Kurtzia for the western area, Flysch Bidache and Gaintzurizketa for the central area, and Chalosse and Salies-de-Béarn for the eastern area. Despite the existence of these areas, the presence of certain flint types shows a larger scale mobility, as evidenced by the high distribution of the Trevino, Urbasa and Chalosse flint. The distribution of allochthonous flint and, to a lesser extent, the autochthonous flint, allow us to see small chronological variations and the different functionality of each site.","Cost distance analysis; Cost units; Dissemination of flint; Fuzzy logic; Upper paleolithic",,,,"Sociedad de Ciencias Aranzadi",11322217,,,,"Spanish","Munibe Antropol.

One of the key dynamics defining this new globalization in the field of business organization is the spread of international expansion to almost all kinds of economic activity. It can be observed that many small and medium-sized enterprises have been forced to adopt global strategies in order to be competitive. Worker cooperatives have not remained untouched by this phenomenon, as evidenced by the emergence of numerous cooperative corporate groups that operate on an international scale with subsidiaries abroad. This globalized scenario has accentuated the degenerative tensions that cooperatives have always had to face in their efforts to uphold their traditional principles and values as they grow in a capitalist setting. This is in fact one of the great challenges facing cooperatives today: the conflict entailed by developing processes of internationalisation that are consistent with their nature. In this vein, as several authors note, currently a key line of research is to investigate how multinational cooperatives can replicate their policies and practices in their capitalist subsidiaries. The Mondragon Group is a stand-out example of the way in which cooperatives have had to grow internationally to remain competitive. It is made up of about 250 cooperatives, and is the 10th biggest corporate group in Spain, with 74,060 employees all over the world. Since the 1990's several of its industrial cooperatives have undertaken internationalization processes that have entailed major increases in their output and in the volume of business that they do on international markets. In 2012 Mondragon's Industrial Division comprised 28 multinational cooperatives and 105 foreign subsidiaries, employing a total of 36,963 people (nearly 14,000 of them abroad). The total sales of the industrial division amounted to €5.812 million and €4.004 million corresponded to international sales, thus resulting in a ratio of international sales of 68.9%. This strategy has increased the competitiveness of these cooperatives and their ability to generate wealth and employment both in the Basque Country and abroad. It has also helped them to weather the current crisis. However, this model of growth based on setting up capitalist subsidiaries abroad calls into question their cooperative nature, as evidenced for instance by the fall in the ratio of cooperative employment. In recent years Mondragon has been promoting a discourse of regeneration based on the importance of encouraging worker participation at its capitalist subsidiaries. In fact, the 8th Mondragon Cooperative Congress (2003) approved a strategy of expansion based on the dissemination of cooperative values at subsidiaries by means of mechanisms for participation similar to those in place at the core cooperatives. In recent years some cooperatives have adopted a discourse based on the need for democratic regeneration at their organisations and on fostering the participation of the workers employed by their capitalist subsidiaries. However, to date few such initiatives have been implemented and results have been limited, especially among foreign subsidiaries. Strangely, the specialized literature has paid little attention to this issue. This article aims to fill that gap. It sets out to investigate the tensions and opportunities entailed in setting up regeneration schemes at multinational cooperatives, focusing on the problems parent cooperatives face in reproducing democratic structures in their capitalist subsidiaries and on potential solutions for those problems. To this end, we conduct a case study of Fagor Ederlan. Founded in 1963, this organization is currently one of the biggest, most important multinational cooperatives at Mondragon, and one of the group's pioneers in expanding into international markets. Its model of internationalization is just like those used by the other large industrial cooperatives in the group: it has grown by acquiring and starting up capitalist firms, first in the domestic market and subsequently abroad. It has plants in strategic regions such as Eastern Europe, America and Asia. Moreover, it is at the cutting edge of development in regeneration processes consisting of implementing the cooperative model at its capitalist subsidiaries. Our analysis goes into greater depth than any that we have found in earlier papers, and focuses on a specific case of democratic regeneration: the transformation of the capitalist subsidiary Fagor Ederlan Tafalla - with over 900 employees - into a mixed cooperative, which is the biggest pioneering initiative of its kind taken to date by a Mondragon industrial cooperative. The method used to investigate Fagor Ederlan is that of ""contemporary case studies"", and it is based on various techniques and drawn on various sources. 11 in-depth face-to-face interviews were held with staff from different areas of Fagor Ederlan. We also consulted a range of documentation provided by the company (sustainability reports, strategy plans, company articles, internal regulations, etc). Furthermore, we also contacted core organisations at Mondragon involved in regeneration processes at the group's cooperatives, such as the LANKI Institute at the University of Mondragon and the MIK (Mondragon Innovation & Knowledge) research centre. Finally, we consulted external publications concerned with Fagor Ederlan and the Mondragon group, press releases and material from their own websites. The limitations of the research reside in drawing broader conclusions for multinational cooperatives based on the analysis of a single case. Nonetheless, the findings obtained are significant both for academics and practitioners. Our findings suggest that regeneration is feasible at multinational cooperatives, either through the conversion of the capitalist subsidiaries into cooperatives or via the promotion of worker participation in such subsidiaries. Moreover, our investigation sheds new light by pointing out possible solutions that may be extrapolated to the democratic regeneration of foreign subsidiaries based on an analysis of the cooperativization of the domestic subsidiary Fagor Ederlan Tafalla. In this vein, the democratization of foreign subsidiaries can be tackled by turning them into ""mixed cooperatives"", in which the degree of control by the parent company is gradually decreased as worker members acquire experience in managing the subsidiary democratically and efficiently. To that end, preliminary processes of information, training and education in cooperative values for workers seem to be essential to establish the basis for future cooperativization schemes. On the other hand, we have also found evidence of external obstacles and internal reluctance along the regeneration process. There are certainly major challenges and tensions involved in fostering such regeneration practices, especially at foreign subsidiaries. Evidence of external barriers has been found at Fagor Ederlan: they include several economic, legal and cultural barriers that hamper the implementation of the cooperative model at subsidiaries. Furthermore, our research goes further and suggests that there may well be internal reluctance and obstacles at parent companies which are even more important, such as the concentration of decision-making power and the wish to retain strategic activities and resources so as to maintain job stability of cooperative members at Basque plants. In short, this paper makes further progress along the path laid out by previous works that analyze the contradictions in the internationalization of Mondragon and the regeneration schemes undertaken to tackle them. The data and assessments set out here may serve to encourage alternative management models and actions to enable firms that compete globally to grow sustainably on the basis of democratic, social values and principles. In this vein, our research provides helpful tools for practitioners to overcome the degenerative tensions that cooperatives face in the current globalized scenario. Finally, it also encourages taking actions at the institutional level in order to facilitate and adapt the legislations on cooperatives to these new realities and cooperativization initiatives. © 2016 CIRIEC-España.","Cooperative; Democracy; Internationalisation; Mondragon; Regeneration",,"Fernández, I.B.; GEZKI-Instituto de Derecho Cooperativo y Economia Social, Plaza Elhuyar, 2, Spain; email: ignaciobretos@gmail.com",,"CIRIEC",19896816,,,,"Spanish","CIRIEC Esp.

Given this, in the last couple of years different programs have been created in the Universities that seek to fill this emptiness that students bring from high school education (Carlino, 2013). This research stands upon the reorientation of one of those corrective courses. One of the essential methods to set up a writing course for the objective users is through the investigation of their representations about the subject (González & Rivera, 2009). Thus, the objective of this research is to describe the social representations around writing that arose from 51 freshmen students' written speech from a Civil Engineering program. The data analysis was based on the procedures of the Grounded Theory. The results show that students perceive writing differently whether it is hard copy writing or a digital copy. In addition, results also show that they do not possess a systematic knowledge about the procedures they need to follow when writing.","Academic writing; Civil engineering; Grounded theory; Social representations",,"Jiménez, A.C.; Instituto de Literatura y Ciencias Del Lenguaje, Chile; email: alejandro.cordova.j@gmail.com",,"Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile",07171285,,,,"Spanish","Onomazein",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983099831

This shortage extends to the opinions and needs of the teachers. In this article we present a study of the beliefs and attitudes of teachers of Spanish in Australia with regards to teaching pronunciation. The data were obtained from teachers of different educational stages and working in several Australian states or territories. In this study we show that the surveyed teachers are interested in pronunciation and are well trained. We also carry out a comparison with the most relevant conclusions reached by similar studies undertaken in other countries.

This phenomenon, coupled with the particularities of land markets, triggers spontaneous settlements that occur in cities in an informal way and with major deficiencies in both the infrastructure and the quality of housing. Approximately one billion people worldwide live in deplorable housing conditions, lack of basic urban services and infrastructure. Most of this population lives in irregular settlements with extreme poverty within the major developing countries. The expansion of this type of settlement is considered as a visual manifestation of poverty itself. In 2000, the UN-HABITAT, organization of the United Nations, issued their ""Millennium Declaration"" in which primary goals were adopted by major world leaders to improve the living conditions of the population living in informal settlements. Although irregular land occupation is a frequent occurrence in the cities, currently there are no reliable estimation techniques to determine its extent and characteristics reliably and expeditiously. It is from this issue, that there is a need to develop a proposal for analysis to identify and delineate the irregular settlements to an urban scale and make a diagnosis of urban infrastructure needs. This dissertation presents an alternative to identify in a timely, reliable and effective manner irregular settlements, so that different levels of government can provide quick response to regularization problems, lack of infrastructure and urban services. This research work involves the development of a model of analysis based on the integration of physical attributes, socioeconomic attributes and the spatial organization of the urban environment, using remote sensing techniques, spatial analysis and census data. These physical attributes include terrain conditions, cooperative, flood, and risk zones. Socioeconomic attributes include income levels, sewage and adaptable water coverage, overcrowding level, center- periphery relationship and land value. The attributes of spatial organization and type of building materials were collected from high-resolution satellite imagery and landscape metrics. These three groups of variables were integrated into a multi-criteria model for irregular settlement identification at Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua, Mexico with a 97.66% of accuracy. The contribution of this research is to present a new reliable method to identify irregular settlements. The achieved results can provide a great asset to help urban development officials in decision making. © 2015, Instituto de Geografia.

Facebook is already part of our social imaginary. Its notoriety has grown exponentially in the Age of Big Data. This article illustrates some of the ways in which social networks might function as a major resource of information for social research. These possibilities are illustrated through the case study of groups of people who drive under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Method. This study is based on quantitative and qualitative tools: a short online survey questionnaire made accessible through Facebook, which allows the obtaining of quantitative primary data, and the qualitative analysis of the Facebook Likes (215,232) of the survey participants (n=1,437). Results. The analysis shows that three risk groups (high, medium, low) can be differentiated among participants based on their driving patterns under the influence of alcohol and drugs and on the basis of the life styles, which they reflect through their Facebook Likes, and of classical structural variables. In particular, the high-risk group exhibits preferences and tastes that are closer to social discontent and resistance, and it is the group with the lowest educational level and the highest rate of casual employment. Conclusions. This research study shows the usefulness of social networks in the socio-demographic and cultural characterisation of risk groups, which must be a preliminary step to the design and dissemination of prevention and awareness-raising campaigns.","Consumption; Facebook; Likes; Road safety; Sociocultural model",,"Universidad Complutense de Madrid (UCM)Spain",,,11385820,,,,"English; Spanish","Rev.

The huge volume of available images requires the use of large computation infrastructures in order to generate this kind of analysis, as well as specific computer vision algorithms. Big data technologies are discussed that can be used for large-scale image processing. In addition, a novel distributed algorithm is proposed that can efficiently retrieve images from an online collection at low computational cost.

The interest towards the integration of students with disabilities has increased in the education sector, being the attitiudes towards this collective one of the most relevant aspects. This study tries to go more deeply in inclusive attitudes in the educational context of students with disabilities according to their parents' perception. The analysis follows the formative cycle estudied by their children (primary, secondary or universitary cycle), the type of dissability (visual, hearing, intellectual and motor) and thedegree ofseverity of the disability. Method. 120 parents of children with different disabilities took part in this report. We designed a questionnaire consisting of a Likert scale of 1 to 5 out of 10 items. The data were analyzed using non parametric Kruskal-Wallis test for single samples k. Results. The results showed statistically significant differences (p<.05), being observed that the parents of sons who belong to University studies with motor and intellectual disability and with a higher grade of disability received the bigger discriminatory attitudes. Discussion. This suggests that there are still serious obstacles in obtaining total inclusion for those people with disabilities and in creating a positive and fundamental basis within the family and the educational world towards disability. © 2014 Sociedad Española de Pedagogía.","Attitudes; Educational integration; Parental perception; Severity of disability; Types of disability",,"Suriá, R.; Departamento de Comunicación y Psicología Social, Carretera San Vicente del Raspeig s/n, Spain; email: raquel.suria@ua.es",,"Sociedad Espanola de Pedagogia",02105934,,,,"Spanish","Bordon",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011620718

Small and medium sized banks had the most significant drop in relative efficiency while larger banks were able to weather the crisis more successfully. This alludes to the idea that ""Bigger is Better"" when dealing with financial shocks to banking efficiency, and would allow us to summarize that the Brazilian banking sector is not participating in the ""Quiet Life"" of concentrated markets. Also, looking at ownership type, the study shows that Brazilian banks that are controlled by the government were ranked as the most efficient types of banks. Their foreignowned counterparts, however, were ranked as the least efficient and had a larger drop in overall efficiency and participation during the financial crisis than their domestic Brazilian counterparts.

In order to do this, objective indicators of employment and income have been compared with social indicators extracted from a specific survey (n=2700) developed in two phases (2009 and 2011). The results show a significant reduction of happiness levels in Andalusia, especially for unemployed people in urban areas and unemployed under the age of 25 living in inland regions. An analysis of individual determinants indicates that the perception of living conditions is determined by employment situation, incomes, health and levels of education. This last variable exhibits an unexpected behavior: subjective valuations of happiness and living conditions are considerably reduced as levels of education are higher. It is also observed that part of the Andalusian population shows an adaptive behavior-conformity-, probably due to a lower level of education. The study of the economic conditions-based on income and employment indicators-takes a prominent place in the social welfare analysis. Without underestimating other elements-such as access to education, health services, etc.-, the influence that employmentsituation and income level have on social welfare is so important that it is hard to find another economic issue which governments and citizens of developed countriesshow as much interest in. An important point is to compare the differences that could exist between objective perception-expressed as socio-economic indicators data- and subjective-revealed by the individuals themselves-. The evolution of labour market in Andalusia was characterized by an important and constant reduction of the unemployment rate until 2006-12.68%, one the lowest values in the last 30 years-. From then on, this value has grown and reached 34.59% in 2012. This growth was especially intense since 2008. During the period 2008-2010 unemployment rate in Andalusia increased by more than 10 percentage points, reaching 27.97%. This increase was translated into a reduction of both Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (2009) and Gross Disposable Household Income (GDHI) per capita (2010). Therefore, the comparison is now based on a better recent past. Gross Disposable Household Income per capita decreased for the first time by the end of 2010 in absolute and relative terms, which means that it will have an effect on personal assessments. This research work describes the relation between unemployment situation and the value of living conditions through three subjective indicators: Happiness Level (HL), Living Conditions (LC) and Household Economic Status (HES). They were estimated in 2009 and 2011. The perception of living conditions has been evaluated through a scale from 1 to 10-HL, LC and HES-. The term ""happiness"" is often used to indicate a subjective enjoyment of life, which detaches itself from material conditions or material/objective welfare (Veenhoven, 2001). In this respect, evaluation of happiness (HL) allows us to identify the perception of some intangible aspects of life while living conditions (LC) and household economic status (HES) refer to the perception of material aspects. In a first approach, a descriptive research that studies the correlation of aggregated data has been carried out in order to check if the increase of unemployment rate in Andalusia may have caused a noticeable deterioration of some of the subjective indicators. This paper analyzes Andalusians' self-assessment in this economic context. This analysis is particularly interesting due to a certain lack of applied research, even when quality of life research works have outlined the existence of adaptive situations. It is considered as a novelty the fact that this study is focused on a period of recession with strong job ""destruction"". The fact that the data processing is based on a territorial division of Andalusia in four different geographic areas: mountain municipalities, inland municipalities and cities, regional capitals and coastal municipalities. This paper work analyzes which personal and territorial factors define self-assessment. Traditionally, the analyses around socio-economic conditions of population have been developed through quantitative indicators but research works based on subjective assessments have increased in importance in the last decades. Research papers have been carried out in different geographic areas and they have shown that objective and subjective dimensions rarely coincide, so there is an increasing interest in analyzing two both together (Erikson, 1993). The proximity between the two stages of the survey restricts the temporal analysis and there are not significant differences. This contrast could have been stronger if the time range had been bigger. However, it is observed a light decline in the three subjective indicators values. The largest drop corresponds to HL (Happiness Level), which falls 3.08%. Focusing on that indicator, it is noticed that the decline is especially significant for unemployed people-from 7.53 in 2009 to 6.98 in 2011-. Furthermore, the biggest fall was registered in HL for unemployed people living in regional capitals -from 7.58 to 6.94- and unemployed under the age of 25 living in inland regions -from 8.23 to 6.94-. That is, we can assume from the aggregate dynamic analysis that during that period there is a reduction of happiness levels in Andalusia, essentially due to unemployed people' assessments. A second analysis describes the individual determinants of HL, LC and HES using multivariate regression models. The overall assessment is better as the indicator is more abstract: HES reaches 5.96 percentage points, LC 7.71 and HL 7.67. The most outstanding variables are: level of education, self-assessment of health status, employment situation and incomes. It is noticed that level of education and self-assessment of health status have a similar influence in employed and unemployed people. On the other hand, even though income always has a positive influence in population -a higher income implies higher levels of HL, LC and HES-, it is more relevant for unemployed people. Of course, a 1£ reduction of income have a bigger impact in unemployed people. Better health and higher income generally increase the indicators values while unemployment situation reduces them. The variable ""level of education"" shows an interesting behavior: a higher level of education usually implies a reduction in both of happiness level (HL) and the value of living conditions (LC). However, even when it is controlled by employment and income, level of education increase the value of household economic status (HES). This result could be the key to explain the adaptive behavior observed in Andalusia and it could be causing a decrease in the level of satisfaction not as big as in the values of employment and income indicators. This is because Andalusians-mostly with a low level of education-exhibit a higher happiness level and better living conditions than people with higher levels of education. The main objective of this research is to emphasize the importance of watching the evolution of living conditions and happiness level in order to evaluate the resultsof distributive policies, whose impact seems to be quite positive in Andalusia, as well as to detect population segments that could be at risk of social exclusion-unemployed under the age of 25, overqualified employees, etc.-. Future researches should compare the situation in Andalusia and other regions of Spain and Europe consulting different sources like ""European Values Study"" or ""Quality of Working Life Survey"".","Andalucía; Crisis; Happiness; Labor market; Living conditions",,,,"Asociacion Universidades Publicas de Andalucia",02137585,,,,"Spanish","Rev.

The nature of our data, with information on vacancies, unemployed workers and job placements, links up our work directly with the search and matching theoretical models. In those models an improvement in the labour information allows to increase the matches per period given a certain number of unemployed workers and job vacancies; if this occurs, the Beveridge curve shifts towards the origin with the consequent reduction of unemployed workers and job vacancies. Our work is not meant to extend or evaluate matching models, but instead it tries to handle empirically important elements involved in these models, as heterogeneities and segmentation. Our data for the empirical application refer to the matches registered in the Andalusian Public Employment Agency (ServicioAndaluz de Empleo, SAE) in the four years 2007 to 2010. The available information allows us to make a detailed division of workers and jobs into groups, with the combination of various characteristics, and yet have enough data in each group to be statistically representative. Three characteristics have been considered for both (workers and jobs): location, defined by municipality (770 different municipalities in our data); skills, defined by group of occupation (482 different occupations); plus sector of economic activity (56 different sectors). In the case of workers we generate ""worker groups"", and for the jobs we have ""job groups"". When there is a job placement, the union of both groups, which do not necessarily have to be of the same type, forms a ""joint group"". During the four years analysed, there was a flow of more than 16 million registered matches, but all the values of the full set of characteristics (the three of the worker and the three of the job) are known in only just over 9 million matches, distributed between 2,848,977 different joint groups, 456,109 different worker groups and 261,167 different job groups. To ensure the representativeness of each group analysed we have decided to consider the entire period as a single time interval. Moreover, in order to manage some of our subsequent calculations in the cluster analysis, we have been forced to reduce the large amount of information available by selecting a sample of 1,542 common groups that appear in the 10,000 joint groups with the most matches; they are ""common"" in the sense that each one appears as a worker group and as a job group in our selected sample. For these 1,542 groups, there are 1,837,123 matches distributed between 69,653 different joint groups. These common groups can be successively grouped into clusters starting from a similarity (or lower distance) measure based on the matches that occur into the period. Thus, we consider that two worker groups are more similar the more they resemble in the way they match with job groups, and that two job groups are more similar the more they resemble in the way they match with worker groups. The clustering process is developed as follows: we define ""similarity"" (lower ""distance"") between two worker groups as the superposition of their matching distributions respect to the job groups, and "" similarity"" between two job groups as the superposition of their matching distributions respect to the worker groups. We have found that the degree of similarity between two worker groups corresponds very significantly with the degree of similarity between those two groups when they are acting as job groups, so we can define the ""proximity"" between any two groups as the average of the two similarities previously defined. We use a hierarchical method of clustering, with groups gradually fusing to form increasingly larger groups or clusters. This method starts by merging the two groups with the highest similarity into a new group or cluster; the similarity of this new group with the rest of the groups is then recalculated, and the next two groups with the highest similarity are merged together. This process continues until we obtain a single cluster for the entire labour market. The grouping process can be visualised with a graphical display called dendrogram or tree diagram. The process can be stopped when a specified number of clusters is reached or when the last similarity calculated falls below a specified level. This clustering process lets us obtain a better overview of the structure of the labour market. To display the results that may be obtained by applying our methodology, we have chosen to analyse two scenarios of grouping. The first scenario is the result of stopping the clustering process when we have only 16 clusters -two clusters per province on average-; in this case, we try to show a better overview of the Andalusian labour market. In a second scenario, the clustering algorithm is stopped when we have a total of 128 clusters -16 clusters per province on average-, so that we can analyse the Andalusian labour market structure in greater detail. For this second scenario, as an illustrative example, the clusters where the provinces of Malaga or Seville dominate are described. The main results obtained are the following: In general, the clustering process generates clusters of large, medium and small size. Small clusters merge with medium and large ones insofar we continue the grouping process. Most clusters are formed connecting neighbouring municipalities; this suggests that workers prefer in general to change their group of occupation or their sector of activity instead of their original location. If we consider the scenario of 128 clusters, we observe that in 87.2% of the matches the worker has been employed within her own cluster. In these ""intra-cluster"" matches, 61.5% of the workers have found employment outside their initial group, so in general Andalusian workers (those who get a job) are seeking for a job in their own group but also in their own cluster (or local labour market captured by our methodology). On one hand, the most frequent occupations observed in the clusters are: other qualified workers in agriculture, agricultural labourers, bricklayers, construction labourers, cleaning staff, shop assistants and waiting staff. On the other hand, the most observed sectors of activity are: agriculture, construction, catering, other entrepreneurial activities, retail sales and Public Administration. In the big clusters (those with more matches) workers aged between 30 and 44 years old stand out, and also those with secondary (general education) or primary education. Additionally, in all clusters there is a clear predominance of fixed-term contracts. The main conclusion of this paper is that worker mobility, geographical or occupational, and the availability of relevant information are important requirements for effective labour matching, and constitute a prominent element that should be taken into account to guide the design of active labour market policies. The empirical tool proposed in this paper may be useful in this regard, by helping jobseekers and firms looking for workers to follow successful paths of matching previously used by others agents with similar characteristics. The clustering methodology allows past information on matches to be processed in order to generate a 'roadmap' of possible routes to different labour market clusters, which can also include the probability of success in each route. The versatility of the methodology proposed makes it possible to enrich the information provided from this perspective and to take into consideration other variables of interest, such as the best search channels for each cluster. Another extension may consist in the comparison among different time periods in order to detect emergent employment sectors.

Method. The paper applies the conceptual framework of the classical theory of diffusion of innovations, along with patterns of life-cycle analysis of technologies (hype cycle) developed by Gartner Group. We compose a model for the analysis of global factors, adapted to the nature of linked data technology. Results. A framework for identifying the level of maturity of the linked data technology drivers is outlined. Our analysis indicates that, despite the intense activity detected in the libraries and archives sector, there is still not enough balance between publication, consumption, regulation and technologies to state that we are entering in the phase of maturity. Conclusions. More linked data initiatives aimed at apps and consumer data are needed, besides exploiting collaborative aspects and build further networks with entities outside the field of libraries, archives and museums.

The factorial analysis was used as a multifarious technique of data analysis. As a result of the research, the Agricultural Modernization Ranking (AMR) was achieved and allowed to rank the Brazilian States according to their agricultural modernization potential. The main factors responsible for the agricultural modernization were: the use of new technologies in relation to the exploited land, to the labor and to the new technologies of logistics and transportation. Based on the identified factors, the results permitted to conclude that the intensity of the modernization process was meaningfully different from the federation unities. This shows the big heterogeneity of the Brazilian States concerning the agricultural modernization. The States with higher AMR were the Federal District, São Paulo and Mato Grosso. The States with lower AMR were Amazonas, Acre, Amapá, Piauí and Maranhão, situated in the North and North-East of Brazil.","Agricultural modernization; Brazil; Intensity in the use of the inputs; Productivity; Relative performance",,"de Medeiros Costa, C.

Secondly, we analyse which individual characteristics (socio-demographic variables, political attitudes and traditional media exposure) explain online exposure to political information. Thirdly, we study to what extent this variable affects political discussion and voter turnout in two election campaigns. Our findings show that only a very small portion of the population in Spain follows online news, and that socioeconomic resources and motivations are significant factors.

Simultaneously, these urban dynamics have also led the metropolitan systems to polycentric structures characterized by dispersion and concentrated decentralization of employment and population, breaking with the paradigm of the monocentric city. However, few studies have focused on studying dynamically (over time) and jointly the delimitation of the metropolitan boundaries and its influence on the urban structure of the metropolitan areas. In this paper, the retrospective urban dynamics (1991-2001) and its influence on the urban structure of the Barcelona Metropolitan Region is analysed. Firstly, by analysing travel-to-work data, the functional metropolitan borders are delimited by the years: 1991, 1996 and 2001. Then, this paper studies how the growth of the metropolitan limits influence on the urban structure by characterizing their changes for the analysed period of time. In doing so, the urban structure is characterized by three key points: i) identification of urban subcentres by using a mobility approach (residence-to-work flows) at the time that it is estimated if they exert influence or not on the urban structure, ii) the complexity grade of the metropolitan system and, iii) the measurement of the polycentrism level taking into account its morphological and functional dimension as well as by proposing a new integrated approach. By having a dynamic perspective (1991-2001), results suggest a process of urban extension of the metropolitan borders what it could entail: an increment of sub-centres due mainly to the changes of the residential and labour markets, a more polynucleated structure of the urban system and a bigger grade of its complexity.","Metropolitan Areas; Polycentricity and sub-centres; Urban structure",,"Masip Tresserra, J.; Centre de Política del Sòl i Valoracions, Avinguda Diagonal 649, 08028, Barcelona, Spain; email: jaume.masip@upc.edu",,"Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya",18877052,,,,"English; Spanish","Archit.

A model to explore the relations among local and global relevance-based information behaviour is proposed that is based on objective and subjective measures of the relevance of the Website contents. Method. Global interest for the Website was researched using data on visits, while local use was explored with two surveys on the motivations and self-assessed knowledge of a group of fifteen students, administered to them before and after being exposed to the information site. Results. Results suggest that improvement in competence perception and the number of visits are, in general, measures of the site relevance that offer similar results. Regarding general data, the most visited competences are those of a more general interest (such as learning to learn), and the students show a big pre-test confidence in their knowledge of most of the studied competences. Conclusions. The increase in the subjective level of competence in an e-learning site is a good predictor of the whole success of a site, when working with their primary intended audience. In the future, to have independent measures, it would be interesting to carry out expert evaluation of the real competences of the students.",,,"Marco, F. J.

The present article shows the first results of exhaustive and longitudinal research of the television content broadcast during the special protection hours. Attention has been paid to violence infractions. With the classic methodology for this type of content research, we analysed over 8,100 hours of visual work and codification. The results offer data from a comparative description of infractions on every network: programmes, people involved in violent acts, period of time and so on. It also shed some light on the evolution of television content over the last four years from a comparative perspective. The article concludes with the resulting data showing how during the last two years, with a stricter self selection of content by networks, the level of infractions has not diminished, and violence is still used by networks to increase their audience share. The final remark is that it seems as if TV channels are victims of their own behaviour when making a choice of content selection. The highest number of infractions are found, in all networks, either public or private, in the programming with which they identify.","Childhood; Infractions; Self-regulation; Special schedule protection; Television; Violence",,"Pérez-Ugena, Á.; Faculty of Science Communication, , Madrid, Spain; email: alvaro.perezugena@urjc.es",,,11343478,,,,"Spanish","Comunicar",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650952210

Even when there is no census data to quantify it after the 2001-2002 crisis, there are several signs that imply that this process continues in the present. Big lessee capitals appear on the leading roll, managing to obtain economies of scale by taking a large tract of land, which allows them to displace their smaller rivals thanks to their capacity to propose the owners a bigger rent or better conditions to pay it. This paper offers the results of an investigation about one of the juridical forms that this process adopts: the setting up of Financial Trust Funds (FTF). The growth of this kind of financial tool since 2004 has been impressive, and it was partially used in the agrarian sector.

The investigation used the data from the registry and analyzed the contextual environmental, personal and social factors in the CIF2, in order to identify which were the determinants of disability. A secondary analysis comes from the data from 86.622 registries (DANE (3), 2005-2006), from the twenty sectors contained in the Distrito Capital de Bogotá. The variables were selected by convenience, following empiric referents of the determinant factors for the CIF (2) that were related to the registry modules about localization and residence, personal identification, characterization and origin of the disability, health, education and participation. Frequency distributions were obtained in percentage and absolute values for each variable.

Usually, on summer, when these ponds dry up, the seasonal wetlands exhibit a whitish surface due to salt precipitation, contrasting with the bluish colour displayed in images. It has been suggested that this apparent paradox results from the fact that sensor records data from an three-dimensional earth and not only from a simple surface. Therefore, in Mediterranean semiarid region satellite images can be used to discriminate wetlands fed by groundwater from other ones having a non sub-surface water contribution.","Groundwater; Inner wetlands; Remote sensing; Salinization","fieldwork; Landsat; Mediterranean environment; remote sensing; satellite imagery; semiarid region; soil quality; water quality; wetland; Eurasia; Europe; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Southern Europe; Spain","Rodríguez, M.P.G.; Departamento de Análisis Geográfico Regional y Geografía Física, Spain; email: mpgarcia@ghis.ucm.es",,,00141496,,,,"Spanish","Estud.

Their dual position as wife and daughter and the need to combine this with work outside the home make heavy demands on them which put their physical and mental health at risk. Aim: To discover the strategies and tools that have helped these women to deal with the implications of caring for a an elderly relative diagnosed as having Alzheimer's disease in phase 3-4. Methods: We used a qualitative design and case study as research methods Data were collected with the strategy of in-depth consecutive interviews. The six participants were women carers aged between 45 and 55, chosen through a theoretical selection of key informants. The study uses an emergent, inductive approach applying categorial content analysis Results and conclusions: Responding to the demands of work and caring leads them to suffer distressing situations in which the carer is aware of loss of control and a high degree of stress, as they themselves express it. In the face of this situation the carers have resorted to cognitive and conductual strategies such as the the search for support, information, hobbies, problem-solving and reassessment. All these coping strategies lead to greater competence in caring for the elderly person, more control of the situation, a better acceptance of the process and a better social adjustment. The end result is a positive approach to this complicated, difficult and stressful situation. © 2007 Fundación Index.",,,"De Retana, B.R.D.A.F.; Escuela de Enfermería de Vitoria-Gasteiz, c/ Jose Achotegui s/n, País Vasco, Spain; email: vrprufeb@vc.ehu.es",,,11321296,,,,"Spanish","Index Enferm.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34548780229

The revision of the nursing literature published about the Acute Coronary Syndrome shows that four are the big themes that have defined to our studies: the performance protocols, the clinical roads, the clinical cases and the methodology of the nursing process. The disease and not so much the patient's illness has been the authentic main character of our writings. With our present work we seek to go into in those more subjective dimensions of the pain, the illness and the sickness. Methodology. It is a qualitative study of descriptive type, in that we present some of the most significant data in the stories of our patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome. Results. We have contained the results in seven thematic categories: pain, fear, impact in the family, impact in the labor activity, impact in the recreational activities, impact in the caretaker role and possible causes. Discussion. The results are compared with other works that have also studied the Acute Coronary Syndrome from diverse perspectives: the sexuality, the verbal describers, the pain, and the testimonies of Mexican women that have passed this same situation. © 2007 Fundación Index.",,,"Padilla, J.H.Avda. de Andalucía n 8, 23006.

The study included 163 children (mean age 39.59 months) from 5 infant schools. Measurements were taken at the time they started school, during their first weeks and at three months—i.e., a longitudinal design in which the data was collected before, during and after the children's schooling. The measures used were reports from the parents, teachers and the children themselves. Some of the most salient results were: 1) the predictive power of parents' opinions and feelings, and their style of upbringing; and 2) some child characteristics related to their temperament and attachment. The predictive power of parents' opinions, feelings and attributions is a big novelty in this field, with the advantage that it is a variable in which it is possible to intervene. © 2004, Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","adaptation to school; brief separation; Children's education",,"Cantero, M.-J.; Dpto. de Psicología Evolutiva y de la Educación, Avda.
